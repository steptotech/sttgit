# Git manager
This project allows you to manage git project and users permissions with OpenSSH and Gitolite.
Based on Debian Linux.

## Quick setup
Add your public ssh key in the directory "services/gitolite/" and name it "admin.pub"; this is the user wich will manager repositories and users.

You can then add users and repos by following the [official guide](https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite#adding-users-and-repos).
